Project Title: Opioids And Non-Physician Prescriptive Powers

_About Me_
I am Arsh Singh, my PhD is in Applied Microeconomonics, and I am interested in applied data science. 


_Project Description_
In this project I am testing my hypothesis that laws allowing non-physicians like Physician's Assistant and Nurse Practitioners may have contributed to the opioid crisis. 


_Data Sources_
I am using ARCOS dataset cleaned and made avaliable by WaPo. The dataset spans 2006-2012 and follows every pill prescribed. 


_Statistical Techniques/Skills_
I am going to infer causality using regression discontinuity.
